# Enhancing Realities with Transformative Video Effect

**Softwares Used** - Cmake, OpenCV, Visual Studio Code, C++, GitHub.<br/>
**Skills Acquired** - Image Processing, Video Processing, Face Detection, User Interaction, Algorithms, Documentation.<br/>

Working on the project, I developed a C++ program using OpenCV for diverse image and video processing tasks. The program, comprising imgDisplay.cpp and vidDisplay.cpp, effectively displayed images, captured live video with user interaction through keypresses, and implemented various filters and transformations. Custom grayscale functions, a sepia tone filter, Sobel X and Y and both naive and optimized blur filters were integrated, showcasing a strong understanding of image manipulation techniques. The inclusion of face detection enhanced the program's capabilities. Additionally, three custom effects, including embossing effects, Brightness and contrast manipulation, recording of filters, vignetting and cartoonization of video demonstrated creativity and the application of computer vision techniques. The project not only improved my proficiency in C++ and OpenCV but also fostered a deeper understanding of image processing concepts, contributing to enhanced problem-solving skills and creative implementation.
